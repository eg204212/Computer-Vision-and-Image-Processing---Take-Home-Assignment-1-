# Take Home Assignment 1 

This repository contains Python implementations of basic image processing tasks. 

**Tasks:**
- Reducing intensity levels (2^n levels).
- Spatial averaging (3x3, 10x10, 20x20).
- Image rotation (45° and 90°).
- Block averaging (3x3, 5x5, 7x7).

**Technologies:** Python, OpenCV, NumPy

**Usage:**  
- Upload an image named `your_image.png`.  

**Results:** Output images saved in the working directory.
